# Bouldering Twister

Web app for playing twister on a bouldering wall built with Typescript and React

Try the live version yourself at https://boulder-twister.vercel.app/


## Description

This app lets you play the popular party game Twister on a bouldering wall. Simply choose a spot on the wall, pick the colors you want too use (you can add your own colors if you want), choose if you want to play with all your limbs or not (you can try an easier version where you place your legs wherever you want) and start playing. To roll the next limb-color combo you just have to tap the screen and when you fall down - click stop and let the next person play.
